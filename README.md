R
Copy code
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("tidymodels")
install.packages("janitor")
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Download the dataset (studentInfo.csv) and place it in the project directory.
Usage
Open the R script (student_performance_prediction.R) in your R environment.
Run the script to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
The script will output the final fitted model along with accuracy metrics.
File Descriptions
student_performance_prediction.R: R script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
